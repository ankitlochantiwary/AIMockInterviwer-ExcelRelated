Ready to begin?\n\nFirst, let's start with a simple one.  Imagine you have a column of numbers in Excel, say, in column A from A1 to A10. How would you calculate the sum of those numbers using a built-in Excel function?"

Remember, we're looking for the name of a built-in Excel function.\n\nLet's try a slightly different question.  How would you find the average of those same numbers (A1 to A10)?"
