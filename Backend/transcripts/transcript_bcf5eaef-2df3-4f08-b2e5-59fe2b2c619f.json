We're going to do a quick assessment of your Excel skills, starting with some easier questions and gradually moving to more complex ones.  Let's begin with a simple one:\n\nCan you tell me how you would calculate the sum of a column of numbers in Excel?  Let's assume the numbers are in column A, starting from cell A1 and going down to A10.  Explain the steps you would take."
